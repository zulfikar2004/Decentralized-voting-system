## Vision
The Decentralized Voting System aims to revolutionize how elections are conducted by leveraging blockchain technology. Our goal is to provide a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof voting process for various elections, ensuring that every vote counts and can be publicly verified on the blockchain. This system can be used in environments ranging from student council elections to corporate governance and even national elections.

## Flowchart

```plaintext
+---------------+      +----------------------+      +----------------+
|   Admin Adds  |      |   Voters Register    |      |  Voting Begins  |
|   Candidates  +----->|    & Get Verified    +----->|   Registered    |
+---------------+      +----------------------+      |   Voters Cast   |
                                                       |    Their Votes |
                                                       +----------------+
```

1. **Admin Adds Candidates**: The admin creates a list of candidates before voting starts.
2. **Voter Registration**: The admin registers eligible voters, ensuring only authorized individuals can vote.
3. **Voting Begins**: Once voting is activated, registered voters can cast their votes.
4. **Vote Tallying and Results**: Votes are automatically tallied, and the winner is announced after the voting period ends.

## Features

- **Admin Functions**: Add candidates, register voters, start and stop voting.
- **Voter Functions**: Registered voters can cast their vote once during the active voting period.
- **Automatic Vote Tallying**: Votes are tallied as they are cast, and results are available instantly after voting ends.
- **Public Verifiability**: All voting transactions are stored on the blockchain for public verification.
- **Winner Announcement**: The contract automatically determines and announces the winner after voting ends.

## Future Scope

The current version of the Decentralized Voting System provides basic functionality. Future developments may include:

1. **Advanced Encryption**: Implementation of zero-knowledge proofs to enhance voter privacy.
2. **Weighted Voting**: Support for voting systems where votes are weighted differently (e.g., corporate governance).
3. **Cross-Chain Voting**: Enable interoperability with other blockchain networks.
4. **Decentralized Governance**: Allow stakeholders to propose and vote on system upgrades.
5. **Multi-Signature Voting**: Support for elections requiring consensus from multiple authorities.
